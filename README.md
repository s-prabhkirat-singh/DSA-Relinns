Task 1: Finding Longest Common Substring

Task Description: Develop an algorithm to efficiently find the longest common substring between two given strings.

In this problem we have to find the longest common substring from the given two strings.

For example 
Str1 = ""asdfghjkl"
str2= ""cbmnhjklmn"
we have to find the substring of the longest possible length.. That means that string must be part of both the strings.

Solution for tyhe same problem is given in the java file. task1.java

this problem can be solved by using the dynamic programming conceprt .
It is solved using DP tabulation method 

The Time complexity of the given code if O(m*n) where m and n are the lengths of the strings respectively.

It can also be solved directly using the recursion method but it can take exponential time so, to reducve the gfiven time the concept of Dynamic programming is introduced.



Task 2: Matrix Multiplication Program

Task Description: Create a program to perform matrix multiplication.
